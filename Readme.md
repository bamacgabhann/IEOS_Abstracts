To revise:

If editing Google Sheets spreadsheets:
> Save them with the same filenames as here, or adjust the filenames in the code  
> Ensure the columns being dropped/renamed are unchanged, or adjust code to match  
> Ensure duplicate row being dropped is still correct, or adjust  

It should be possible to clone the repository and use pyenv and poetry to recreate the virtual environment, but it might be easier to:

<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/bamacgabhann/IEOS_Abstracts/blob/main/IEOS%20abstracts.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

Upload all the font files, the spreadsheets, and the header image to the same Colab folder as the ipynb.

Then simply run all cells, and download the produced PDF.
